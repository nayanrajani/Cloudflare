Client and Cloudflare we can however also pass the cert fingerprint/serial number to origin if you need to do more validation

On the edge-to-origin-server side, there is also another certificate process that is outlined here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/#2-authenticate-cloudflared

What would be a typical implementation look like if customer has 60-70 applications hosted in data centre? Do we need to create cloudflared tunnel for each application?

No. This will be covered tomorrow. we have customers running thousands of tunnels

can we add additional apps to the tunnel created via the dashboard?

Only one application can be attached to a tunnel

Frank Taylor

But that “application” can be a TCP load balancer, for example; it doesnt have to be a specific protocol in that sense

How many tunnels I can run at a single time?
and how many private applications i can run from a single device?

This is one answer to this question - use Private Network to expose the entire machine

Do we need additional VM in use case 2 if different applications are on different servers?

There are switches that can be used to ignore self signed certificate trust issues. So the connection from the cloudflared to the origin server will ignore certificate warnings.

Content Category and Security Category are both in DNS and HTTP policy. May I know what the difference between them is? And if we want to block, for example, socialmedia apps, do we need to create rules for both DNS and HTTP policy?

Gateway has two modes - HTTP mode and DNS mode. If you are using it in HTTP mode (“Gateway with WARP”) then you need to use HTTP policies. Otherwise, you need to create DNS policies

How will Alerts be sent in case a rule is hot and Block action takes place. I know the logs, but how about alerts ?

We don’t support that kind of customized alerting in the dashboard today. We offer the ability for customers to export logs to their SEIM in real-time, and alerts can be configured there.

what is the idea behind not supporting alerting ? For a product like ZT, the customer should ideally be notified in case of an event. A security product MSP should be blocking and notifing about the events. Are there any future plans of alert integration ?

My understanding is that for DNS, you block the access only based on DNS resolution request, e.g. netflix.com, without ability to define the detail action pertaining to the block policy. With HTTP policy, you're able to define more detailed attributes related to blocking, e.g allow access of netflix.com, but block downloading files from netflix.com. You can define either DNS OR HTTP, depending on the intention.

Thats correct. DNS is connectionless, and independent of application-layer protocols

No it doesn’t. Have you enabled the App Launcher under Settings —> Authentication —> App Launcher?

If you want to display the apps in the app launcher make sure you configure IdP + policy.

while we are testing the logpush to a logcollector, the "action" field (allow/block) is not included in the logpush whether it is DNS or Network log. is this an expected behavior?
