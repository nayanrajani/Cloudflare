On the edge-to-origin-server side, there is also another certificate process that is outlined here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/#2-authenticate-cloudflared

But that “application” can be a TCP load balancer, for example; it doesnt have to be a specific protocol in that sense

There are switches that can be used to ignore self signed certificate trust issues. So the connection from the cloudflared to the origin server will ignore certificate warnings.
