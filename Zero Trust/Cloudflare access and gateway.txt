Cloudflare Access->

In the matter of Zero Trust, you can easily think of your personal things that you own where you have stored 
them like your own cash, or things that you don't want to share with anyone, those things are stored in your 
almirah, and the key to acces the almirah belongs to you only. Zero trust is like that, or as an simple 
example- when you access to your internet banking only the credentials are not required but sometime an 
otp to access is required it means "No trust, verify all".
