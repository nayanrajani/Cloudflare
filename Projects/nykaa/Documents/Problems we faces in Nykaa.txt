Problems faced

1. Ip spoofing after Domain onboard before making any DNS entry

2. Cf-device type header to be enabled from Backend(Application-level)

3. Advance certificate configuration to be enabled from CF at the backend 

4. Rearrange the Page rules according to preference (otherwise watch video again)

5. Please do not depend on Universal Certificate (Down time around 30 minutes), better to order the advance.

6. Please delete extra DNS record from the DNS portion (Please consult with the client as well)

7. Redirect of a domain from a 20xyz.com(Not on cloudflare) to twentyxyz.com (Not possible)

8. Please update the WAf from the older to Newer version, update by CF Team (Consult with client for downtime)

9. If a client wants to seperate the pre-prod and prod traffic so it is a better choice to have a seperate domain for pre-prod 
   and prod.

10. Accept-encoding header will not be added to any page-rules.

11. In the workers if you are adding any URL to match regex expression, it will not accept the * (Wild card) in between the URL.

12. If Client tell you they are getting "dynamic" as a cache-status for any page rule, then just go to particular page rule and 
    "add a setting" for "chache-level -> Cache Everything" (If not present).
