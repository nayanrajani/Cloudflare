1. Nykaad -> for manual work we need to generate the tf file (No Terraform for now)
	  -> monday or tuesday to be in production
	  -> same rules as in nykaa.com accept page rule
	  -> there are only 3 to 4 page rules
	  -> this is the last domain and need to be configured till friday
	  -> no rate limit, no firewall rule, no page rules, no DNS record.

2. There are some subdomains will be on-boarded after some time, which are not depended on F5.

3. Nykaa have more internal sub-domains to implement on cloudflare in future.

4. The page rules meeting call with cloudflare will be set-up tomorrow.

5. 20dresses.com and twentydresses.com will not be resolved on the cloudflare due to the name thing, 
   that's why cloudflare is rejecting the request for 20dresses.com

6. Team will start working on Managed service by End-of the week.

7. DNS rules to be sorted (those rules which are not required we can remove tomorrow 02:00 to 03:00)
