If you met with a DDOS- Cloudflare DDOS threshold is 2000 request per minute

1. try to see the request per minute (rpm).

2. change the rate limit (threshold) settings for every URL, to the better range that you have seen during DDOS Attack.

3. Change the setting for DDOS to default if you have changed, otherwise it is okay
